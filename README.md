# Corona Scanning

## 29th March 2020
This peoject is meant to be able to develop a corona scanner using some ultra-violet scanning and identifying through AI. An initial idea and hypothetical development algorithem is proposed as followed. This project is open source and contributions from everyone around the world will be appreciated.

- Imagine an ultra violet scanner glasses which can detect the microbian life i.e kind of a radio microscope
- And the resulting scanned vision of this microscopic scanner or glasses is fed into an AI program similar to that of image recognition and thus AI program can then recognise and classify if there is an existence of corona virus
- Image someone wearing those glasses or scanning through that scanner see the existence of corona virus i.e depicted with some red dot or a red tiny cluster

- So the first step would be to be able to scan microbian life through some ultra violet scanners
- and second step will be to feed that vision to the AI program for it to be able to recognize a pattern for a corona virus
